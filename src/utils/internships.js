The goal is to simplify the ranking process for this competition. Admins can upload Excel files containing judges\' scores, which automatically rank the participants. The system calculates the top 3 scores for Danton, top 3 for PBB, top 10 for formation variations, and determines the overall champion. Users can download the final results in Excel format. This eliminates the need for manual ranking, as the competition organizers only need to upload the judges\' scores.',
